# CO2 emissions application  

This is a small application that I made for viewing different countries CO2 emissions.  

## Requirements  

Python 3.6.5  
Node v10.8.0  
npm 6.2.0  

## Setup  

### Install npm dependencies  
$ npm install in both /restapi and /frontend folders  

### Fetch zipped csv data and modify data to right format  
$ python restapi/data_script.py  

### Start app  
$ npm start in both /restapi and /frontend folders  

Frontend application should now be running on localhost:3000.
